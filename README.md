with the help of SQLALCHEMY database system, flask server and POSTMAN, I created my own API, which is actually called CAFE API. But first of all, I think a RESTFUL API is not api without its database, because every time we are making requests we need some data to be fetched, therefore please install DATABASE viewer from the internet and introduce yourself with the data that is in there.

PS. After creating this amazing thing, I realized how important the API is... So never stop learning!

Best regards! Davlatbek.
